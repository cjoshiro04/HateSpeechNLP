He does!\\nVerstappen's on pole here in Zandvoort.There's the Mercedes of Bottas and Hamilton,who can try and deny him\\nhis first pole position in his home Grand Prix.Now on the banking\\nwe go with Valtteri Bottas,who knows what it's like in the Junior Formula\\nto have success here.But at the moment Bottas can only make\\nsecond place on the grid.Can Hamilton deny Max Verstappen?\\nThe two championship protagonists,battling it in qualifying.\\nHamilton is alongside Max Verstappenon the front row\\nfor what will be the sixth time in 2021.But the celebration's here in Zandvoort\\nfor the home favourite: Max Verstappen.No one could deny him pole.And by three one hundredths of a second\\nhe takes it over Hamilton.- \\\"That is pole position, mate!\\nPole position, home Grand Prix.Really proud of you.\\nNice job.\\\"- \\\"Haha! Yes, guys, unbelievable.\\nWhat a great car today. It was unbelievable.It was flying!\\nThank you so much!\\\"- Sixth pole in the last seven races\\nfor Max Verstappen,sharing the front row with Hamilton\\nfor the sixth time in 2021.Wow! We've seen them battling in Lap 1.\\nWe've seen them coming together in Lap 1.We don't know how this race\\nis going to pan out.The teams don't know\\nbecause we haven't been to Zandvoort for 36 years.What we do know is the two fastest drivers on the grid,\\nand the two best drivers on the grid,are going to be starting alongside each other.\",\n          \"Some critics of the TV show Mythbusters claimthat the show misrepresents the scientific process.For example, experiments are sometimes conducted only onceand without adequate controls,but then these results aregeneralized to make definitive claimsrather than repeating the experimentand using statistical analysis as a scientist wouldto figure out what is really true.So, ironically a showthat is meant to educate people about sciencemay instead be giving them the opposite impressionof how science works.But you know, similar criticisms had been made of Veritasium.For example, when Destin and I performedour experiments to show that the water swirlsthe opposite way in the northern and southern hemispheres,we only showed doing it onceeven though we each did it three or four times in our own hemisphere.And I guess that brings forth the questionshould we change what we're doing --I mean should Mythbusters and Veritasiumreally show the repetitive nature of scienceand use statistical results as evidence for our claims.Well my answer is no, but to understand whywe first have to dig into something calledthe helping experiment.And this was performed in New Yorkin the 1960s. And the way it went was --individual participants were placed in isolated boothswhere they could speak to five other participants through an intercombut only one mic was live at a time.And these participants were meant to speak in turnsfor two minutes each about their lives --any problems they were having --and it would just go in rounds.Now what the participants didn't know was thatone of them was actually an actorwho was reading a scriptprepared for him by the experimenters.And he went first in the first round.He talked about the problems he was having adjusting to life in New York Cityand particularly the difficulty that he gets the seizures, particularly when stressed.And so everyone else had their turn and then it came back 'roundto this actor again. Now this timewhen he was speaking he became more and more incoherent as hewas talking. He said that he could feel a seizure coming on and he made choking noises,he asked for help from the other participants --he said he felt like he was dying --and, uh, then he continued to get more and more distresseduntil his mic went off.And the point of the experiment was to see how many of the participants would help.I mean, if you were one of the other participants, do you think you would've left your boothand gone to see if he was okay?In total, about 13 participants took part in this experiment --and the number that helped before his mic was turned off --was just four.Now, while this might sound a little bit disappointingabout the state of human helpfulness,you gotta keep in mind that there were other people listening to the same distress calland that may have diffused the responsibility that individuals would feel;this is something known as the \\\"bystander effect.\\\"Now, what's interesting about this experiment from my point of viewis not how it confirms the bystander effect,but in how people view the results.For example, they fail to change their opinionof themselves or others after learning about this experiment.For example, have you changed your opinionabout how likely you would be to help in this situation --now that you know that only 30 percent of people did, in that situation?Well, there was a follow-up study conductedwhere students were shown two videosof individual participants who were purported to be from the original study.And they had already learned about the study,and then they were asked at the end of watching those two videos --which were pretty uninformative, just showed that these people weregood, decent, ordinary people --these students were asked,\\\"How likely do you think it wasthat those two particular participants helped?\\\"And overwhelmingly students feltthat those two participants would have helped --even though they knew that, statistically, only 30 percent did, so,in fact, if would've been a better guess to say that they probably didn't.They didn't seem to really internalizethose general results as pertaining to the particular,they kind of assumed it excludedordinary, good, decent people.Now, is there a way to get people to reallyunderstand how the world works?Well, they did another follow-up studywhere they talked about the experiment,they described the experiment,but they didn't give the results.And then they showed those two participant videos --again, not mentioning anything about the experiment,just showing that these are two, decent, ordinary peopleand then they told the students that those two peopledid not help in the experiment.And they asked the students to, uh, guesswhat proportion of people did help.And now, in this case, when they were goingfrom those particular examples of ordinary, nice peoplewho didn't help,they were much better at generalizingto the overall result,to the statistical result.In fact, they got it basically right.And I think this highlights for us thatour brains are much better atworking with individual storiesand things in detailthan they are with statistical results.And that is why I thinkif you're Mythbusters or Veritasiumit's better to communicate science --to tell the story,to show the experiment, really, once in a dramatic way --rather than three or four timeswhere each new iteration --well, each repetition --just confirms the original result that you were talking about.But if you're actually doing the science.If you're actually trying to establish scientific fact --then of courseyou need the repetition and the statistical analysis.So I think it really does come down to what your objectives are.But with this conclusionI think this opens uptwo big potential pitfalls.One is that people without scientific evidencecan make crafty storiesthat catch onand quickly become what people feel is the truth.And the other pitfall is scientistsWho have strong scientific evidence --Who have clear statistical results --and yet they can't communicate them to peoplebecause they don't have a great story.So, an example of the first pitfallis the recent spread of this rumorThat the outbreak of a birth defect microsephalyin South America was actually causedby a larvicide made by Monsanto.That story caught on like wildfire.And you can see why because its got this clear villain --that everyone loves to hate -- in Monsanto.And its got a really causal storyThat someone is doing something badto the water -- and its this poisonthat were poisoning ourselves andits a very emotive -- clear -- story.While the other story is, uh,Well it's a little bit more statistical -- that there issome kind of connection -- which is the scientific consensusThat the Zika virus carried bythese, uh, mosquitoesis causing the microsephaly.And there are strong indications that that really is what's happening.And if you look at the claims about the larvicide,they really don't hold much weight.I mean, the larvicide is so weak,that you could drink a thousand litres of it a day.A thousand litres of the water treated with this larvicide and have no adverse effects.Or, uh, this larvicide has been used in dog and cat pet collars.Um, so really, you know, there isn't strong evidence for the larvicide connection. In factThere is no connection between the larvicide and Monsanto at all.But I think the story took hold because it had such a strong narrativeOn the other hand, you have things like climate change,which have very strong statistical evidence to back them up,large scale result over the globe.And yet, one cold snowy winter is so much more, uh,visceral and meaningful to individual peoplethan this thing which feels, you know,completely databased.And, it just depends on how much you trust data, I guess.As scientists, we love data.And we feel like, if we're trying to communicate to someone,we're trying to convince someone of something,all we have to do is show more data.But what experiments demonstrate to us with statistical certaintyis that stories work much better.Normally I do this walk and talk self videos on my second channel, 2Veritasium, butI imagine that some of you might not know that that exists.So, I thought I'd put one of these here on 1Veritasium.Plus, this one has a fair amount of data and, you know, experimental stuff in it,so I figured that could be interesting for you as well.So if you want to check out the check...[CHUCKLES]So if you want to check out the second channel, thengo to 2Veritasium. I'll put a card or something for it up here.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And the way it went was --individual participants were placed in isolated boothswhere they could speak to five other participants through an intercombut only one mic was live at a time.And these participants were meant to speak in turnsfor two minutes each about their lives --any problems they were having --and it would just go in rounds.Now what the participants didn't know was thatone of them was actually an actorwho was reading a scriptprepared for him by the experimenters.And he went first in the first round.He talked about the problems he was having adjusting to life in New York Cityand particularly the difficulty that he gets the seizures, particularly when stressed.And so everyone else had their turn and then it came back 'roundto this actor again. Now this timewhen he was speaking he became more and more incoherent as hewas talking. He said that he could feel a seizure coming on and he made choking noises,he asked for help from the other participants --he said he felt like he was dying --and, uh, then he continued to get more and more distresseduntil his mic went off.And the point of the experiment was to see how many of the participants would help.I mean, if you were one of the other participants, do you think you would've left your boothand gone to see if he was okay?In total, about 13 participants took part in this experiment --and the number that helped before his mic was turned off --was just four.Now, while this might sound a little bit disappointingabout the state of human helpfulness,you gotta keep in mind that there were other people listening to the same distress calland that may have diffused the responsibility that individuals would feel;this is something known as the \\\"bystander effect.\\\"Now, what's interesting about this experiment from my point of viewis not how it confirms the bystander effect,but in how people view the results.For example, they fail to change their opinionof themselves or others after learning about this experiment.For example, have you changed your opinionabout how likely you would be to help in this situation --now that you know that only 30 percent of people did, in that situation?Well, there was a follow-up study conductedwhere students were shown two videosof individual participants who were purported to be from the original study.And they had already learned about the study,and then they were asked at the end of watching those two videos --which were pretty uninformative, just showed that these people weregood, decent, ordinary people --these students were asked,\\\"How likely do you think it wasthat those two particular participants helped?\\\"And overwhelmingly students feltthat those two participants would have helped --even though they knew that, statistically, only 30 percent did, so,in fact, if would've been a better guess to say that they probably didn't.They didn't seem to really internalizethose general results as pertaining to the particular,they kind of assumed it excludedordinary, good, decent people.Now, is there a way to get people to reallyunderstand how the world works?Well, they did another follow-up studywhere they talked about the experiment,they described the experiment,but they didn't give the results.And then they showed those two participant videos --again, not mentioning anything about the experiment,just showing that these are two, decent, ordinary peopleand then they told the students that those two peopledid not help in the experiment.And they asked the students to, uh, guesswhat proportion of people did help.And now, in this case, when they were goingfrom those particular examples of ordinary, nice peoplewho didn't help,they were much better at generalizingto the overall result,to the statistical result.In fact, they got it basically right.And I think this highlights for us thatour brains are much better atworking with individual storiesand things in detailthan they are with statistical results.And that is why I thinkif you're Mythbusters or Veritasiumit's better to communicate science --to tell the story,to show the experiment, really, once in a dramatic way --rather than three or four timeswhere each new iteration --well, each repetition --just confirms the original result that you were talking about.But if you're actually doing the science.If you're actually trying to establish scientific fact --then of courseyou need the repetition and the statistical analysis.So I think it really does come down to what your objectives are.But with this conclusionI think this opens uptwo big potential pitfalls.One is that people without scientific evidencecan make crafty storiesthat catch onand quickly become what people feel is the truth.And the other pitfall is scientistsWho have strong scientific evidence --Who have clear statistical results --and yet they can't communicate them to peoplebecause they don't have a great story.So, an example of the first pitfallis the recent spread of this rumorThat the outbreak of a birth defect microsephalyin South America was actually causedby a larvicide made by Monsanto.That story caught on like wildfire.And you can see why because its got this clear villain --that everyone loves to hate -- in Monsanto.And its got a really causal storyThat someone is doing something badto the water -- and its this poisonthat were poisoning ourselves andits a very emotive -- clear -- story.While the other story is, uh,Well it's a little bit more statistical -- that there issome kind of connection -- which is the scientific consensusThat the Zika virus carried bythese, uh, mosquitoesis causing the microsephaly.And there are strong indications that that really is what's happening.And if you look at the claims about the larvicide,they really don't hold much weight.I mean, the larvicide is so weak,that you could drink a thousand litres of it a day.A thousand litres of the water treated with this larvicide and have no adverse effects.Or, uh, this larvicide has been used in dog and cat pet collars.Um, so really, you know, there isn't strong evidence for the larvicide connection. In factThere is no connection between the larvicide and Monsanto at all.But I think the story took hold because it had such a strong narrativeOn the other hand, you have things like climate change,which have very strong statistical evidence to back them up,large scale result over the globe.And yet, one cold snowy winter is so much more, uh,visceral and meaningful to individual peoplethan this thing which feels, you know,completely databased.And, it just depends on how much you trust data, I guess.As scientists, we love data.And we feel like, if we're trying to communicate to someone,we're trying to convince someone of something,all we have to do is show more data.But what experiments demonstrate to us with statistical certaintyis that stories work much better.Normally I do this walk and talk self videos on my second channel, 2Veritasium, butI imagine that some of you might not know that that exists.So, I thought I'd put one of these here on 1Veritasium.Plus, this one has a fair amount of data and, you know, experimental stuff in it,so I figured that could be interesting for you as well.So if you want to check out the check...[CHUCKLES]So if you want to check out the second channel, thengo to 2Veritasium. I'll put a card or something for it up here.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

others\\nwere trying to build a gap.- \\\"We're out, Checo.\\\"\\n- \\\"OK. ******* brilliant!They were so slow with these guys\\non the pit lane.\\\"- A disappointing start to the weekend for him\\nafter a pretty, pretty tough weekend in Spa.- Nikita Mazepin is out of qualifying.\\nThat incident involving him and Sebastian Vettelis going to be investigated after the session.\\nSchumacher's out as well.- Head down.\\nOooh! And he's...I was going to say he's very aggressive\\non the way in, and he was.- Too aggressive on the way in,\\nand all the anticipation that was buildingin that Williams garage...\\nGeorge Russell is out of qualifying.If you're not pushing, you're not trying,\\nand he was definitely trying,and he was definitely pushing.- He's on the limit. It's going to happen\\nat some point. Do you know what I mean?You can't have a perfect\\nqualifying session every race.Ooh! Touched the grass!\\n- Oooh! That's another Williams!And that is a bigger impact,\\nand that's Nicholas Latifivery much out of qualifying,\\nand that is another red flag.- \\\"Are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?\\\"\\n- \\\"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.\\\"- He's out of qualifying, as is Yuki Tsunoda,\\nLando Norris, Lance Stroll, and George Russell,because the session\\nwill not be resumed.- We've seen with Max when the car's\\na little bit twitchyhe is super fast, and I think\\nwe're going to see that right now.- No Dutch driver has ever started higher\\nthan 14th for a Dutch Grand Prix.Max Verstappen in the 1:08s\\nand that has delighted the Dutch crowd here.He was a couple of tenths up on both Valtteri Bottas\\nand Lewis Hamilton through the first sector.He was two tenths up on Valtteri Bottas\\nthrough the middle sector.He was a tenth up on this man, Lewis Hamilton,\\nthrough the middle sector,Pushing, Max Verstappen, and maybe pushing\\nMercedes to places they just can't go here,because Valtteri Bottas\\nfinishes three tenths behind Verstappen,as we watch Hamilton coming off\\nthe banking and the final corner.Is he the man that can deny Verstappen pole?\\nNot on this evidence.He's three and a bit tenths off Verstappen,\\nand he's behind his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas.Verstappen starts his final flying lap.Valtteri Bottas, Lewis Hamilton,\\nDaniel Ricciardo are the threethat haven't started their flying lap\\nas yet.Hamilton might get caught by Leclerc\\ngoing through the final corner,as Verstappen continues on his way\\nand takes that high line around the banking at Turn 3.A slingshot on the exit out towards Turn 4,\\nand a nice, fast-flowing esses section,as we can watch Lewis Hamilton\\ngoing around the banking.Leclerc finishes his lap.\\nGoes fourth fastest.Hamilton gets to the line\\nwith about eight seconds to spare.So it's going to be\\nright down to the last gaspsfor Verstappen to see if he's got pole here.\\nAnd he's going to have to be waitinga long time for the Mercedes\\nto cross the line.Chequered flag is out,\\nas Pierre Gasly goes fourth fastest.Retakes that position on the second row.\\nThat is a super performance from him.Ferrari fifth and sixth.\\nEsteban Ocon goes seventh fastest.Verstappen's going quicker\\nthrough that middle sector.Roar of approval from the fans\\nas they see that one.And they rise to acclaim Max Verstappen here,\\nas Giovinazzi goes seventh fastest.And that's a super qualifying performance\\nfrom him.Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton\\nseem to be the only two that can deny Max Verstappen,who might yet go quicker\\nthan his provisional pole time.Guess what? He does!\\nVerstappen's on pole here in Zandvoort.There's the Mercedes of Bottas and Hamilton,who can try and deny him\\nhis first pole position in his home Grand Prix.Now on the banking\\nwe go with Valtteri Bottas,who knows what it's like in the Junior Formula\\nto have success here.But at the moment Bottas can only make\\nsecond place on the grid.Can Hamilton deny Max Verstappen?\\nThe two championship protagonists,battling it in qualifying.\\nHamilton is alongside Max Verstappenon the front row\\nfor what will be the sixth time in 2021.But the celebration's here in Zandvoort\\nfor the home favourite: Max Verstappen.No one could deny him pole.And by three one hundredths of a second\\nhe takes it over Hamilton.- \\\"That is pole position, mate!\\nPole position, home Grand Prix.Really proud of you.\\nNice job.\\\"- \\\"Haha! Yes, guys, unbelievable.\\nWhat a great car today. It was unbelievable.It was flying!\\nThank you so much!\\\"- Sixth pole in the last seven races\\nfor Max Verstappen,sharing the front row with Hamilton\\nfor the sixth time in 2021.Wow! We've seen them battling in Lap 1.\\nWe've seen them coming together in Lap 1.We don't know how this race\\nis going to pan out.The teams don't know\\nbecause we haven't been to Zandvoort for 36 years.What we do know is the two fastest drivers on the grid,\\nand the two best drivers on the grid,are going to be starting alongside each other.\",\n          \"Some critics of the TV show Mythbusters claimthat the show misrepresents the scientific process.For example, experiments are sometimes conducted only onceand without adequate controls,but then these results aregeneralized to make definitive claimsrather than repeating the experimentand using statistical analysis as a scientist wouldto figure out what is really true.So, ironically a showthat is meant to educate people about sciencemay instead be giving them the opposite impressionof how science works.But you know, similar criticisms had been made of Veritasium.For example, when Destin and I performedour experiments to show that the water swirlsthe opposite way in the northern and southern hemispheres,we only showed doing it onceeven though we each did it three or four times in our own hemisphere.And I guess that brings forth the questionshould we change what we're doing --I mean should Mythbusters and Veritasiumreally show the repetitive nature of scienceand use statistical results as evidence for our claims.Well my answer is no, but to understand whywe first have to dig into something calledthe helping experiment.And this was performed in New Yorkin the 1960s. And the way it went was --individual participants were placed in isolated boothswhere they could speak to five other participants through an intercombut only one mic was live at a time.And these participants were meant to speak in turnsfor two minutes each about their lives --any problems they were having --and it would just go in rounds.Now what the participants didn't know was thatone of them was actually an actorwho was reading a scriptprepared for him by the experimenters.And he went first in the first round.He talked about the problems he was having adjusting to life in New York Cityand particularly the difficulty that he gets the seizures, particularly when stressed.And so everyone else had their turn and then it came back 'roundto this actor again. Now this timewhen he was speaking he became more and more incoherent as hewas talking. He said that he could feel a seizure coming on and he made choking noises,he asked for help from the other participants --he said he felt like he was dying --and, uh, then he continued to get more and more distresseduntil his mic went off.And the point of the experiment was to see how many of the participants would help.I mean, if you were one of the other participants, do you think you would've left your boothand gone to see if he was okay?In total, about 13 participants took part in this experiment --and the number that helped before his mic was turned off --was just four.Now, while this might sound a little bit disappointingabout the state of human helpfulness,you gotta keep in mind that there were other people listening to the same distress calland that may have diffused the responsibility that individuals would feel;this is something known as the \\\"bystander effect.\\\"Now, what's interesting about this experiment from my point of viewis not how it confirms the bystander effect,but in how people view the results.For example, they fail to change their opinionof themselves or others after learning about this experiment.For example, have you changed your opinionabout how likely you would be to help in this situation --now that you know that only 30 percent of people did, in that situation?Well, there was a follow-up study conductedwhere students were shown two videosof individual participants who were purported to be from the original study.And they had already learned about the study,and then they were asked at the end of watching those two videos --which were pretty uninformative, just showed that these people weregood, decent, ordinary people --these students were asked,\\\"How likely do you think it wasthat those two particular participants helped?\\\"And overwhelmingly students feltthat those two participants would have helped --even though they knew that, statistically, only 30 percent did, so,in fact, if would've been a better guess to say that they probably didn't.They didn't seem to really internalizethose general results as pertaining to the particular,they kind of assumed it excludedordinary, good, decent people.Now, is there a way to get people to reallyunderstand how the world works?Well, they did another follow-up studywhere they talked about the experiment,they described the experiment,but they didn't give the results.And then they showed those two participant videos --again, not mentioning anything about the experiment,just showing that these are two, decent, ordinary peopleand then they told the students that those two peopledid not help in the experiment.And they asked the students to, uh, guesswhat proportion of people did help.And now, in this case, when they were goingfrom those particular examples of ordinary, nice peoplewho didn't help,they were much better at generalizingto the overall result,to the statistical result.In fact, they got it basically right.And I think this highlights for us thatour brains are much better atworking with individual storiesand things in detailthan they are with statistical results.And that is why I thinkif you're Mythbusters or Veritasiumit's better to communicate science --to tell the story,to show the experiment, really, once in a dramatic way --rather than three or four timeswhere each new iteration --well, each repetition --just confirms the original result that you were talking about.But if you're actually doing the science.If you're actually trying to establish scientific fact --then of courseyou need the repetition and the statistical analysis.So I think it really does come down to what your objectives are.But with this conclusionI think this opens uptwo big potential pitfalls.One is that people without scientific evidencecan make crafty storiesthat catch onand quickly become what people feel is the truth.And the other pitfall is scientistsWho have strong scientific evidence --Who have clear statistical results --and yet they can't communicate them to peoplebecause they don't have a great story.So, an example of the first pitfallis the recent spread of this rumorThat the outbreak of a birth defect microsephalyin South America was actually causedby a larvicide made by Monsanto.That story caught on like wildfire.And you can see why because its got this clear villain --that everyone loves to hate -- in Monsanto.And its got a really causal storyThat someone is doing something badto the water -- and its this poisonthat were poisoning ourselves andits a very emotive -- clear -- story.While the other story is, uh,Well it's a little bit more statistical -- that there issome kind of connection -- which is the scientific consensusThat the Zika virus carried bythese, uh, mosquitoesis causing the microsephaly.And there are strong indications that that really is what's happening.And if you look at the claims about the larvicide,they really don't hold much weight.I mean, the larvicide is so weak,that you could drink a thousand litres of it a day.A thousand litres of the water treated with this larvicide and have no adverse effects.Or, uh, this larvicide has been used in dog and cat pet collars.Um, so really, you know, there isn't strong evidence for the larvicide connection. In factThere is no connection between the larvicide and Monsanto at all.But I think the story took hold because it had such a strong narrativeOn the other hand, you have things like climate change,which have very strong statistical evidence to back them up,large scale result over the globe.And yet, one cold snowy winter is so much more, uh,visceral and meaningful to individual peoplethan this thing which feels, you know,completely databased.And, it just depends on how much you trust data, I guess.As scientists, we love data.And we feel like, if we're trying to communicate to someone,we're trying to convince someone of something,all we have to do is show more data.But what experiments demonstrate to us with statistical certaintyis that stories work much better.Normally I do this walk and talk self videos on my second channel, 2Veritasium, butI imagine that some of you might not know that that exists.So, I thought I'd put one of these here on 1Veritasium.Plus, this one has a fair amount of data and, you know, experimental stuff in it,so I figured that could be interesting for you as well.So if you want to check out the check...[CHUCKLES]So if you want to check out the second channel, thengo to 2Veritasium. I'll put a card or something for it up here.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
